      <description>Welcome again to the Rplicate Series! In this 4th article of the series, we will replicate The Economist plot titled &amp;ldquo;Gone Baby Gone&amp;rdquo;. In the process, we will explore ways to use transformed value as our axes, adding horizontal/vertical line, and making an elbow line (and generally more flexible) annotation for repelled texts.
Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in below!

      <description>In this third article on Rplicate Series, We will share to you one way to replicate The Economist plot titled &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t get no &amp;hellip;&amp;quot;. The plot making will also demonstrate ways to converting smooth line into linear line, using guides for legend, and adding a text annotation to a plot. The raw dataset used for this graph was obtained from a PDF, so we will also use tibble package to copy-paste the data into R.</description>

      <description>In this second article on Rplicate Series, We will share to you one way to replicate the plot titled Cherry Bomb from the article &amp;ldquo;Japanâ€™s cherry blossoms are emerging increasingly early, 7th April 2017&amp;rdquo;. The raw dataset used for this graph was obtained from a phenological dataset that was previously collected by Dr. Yasuyuki Aono from Osaka Prefecture University12.
While replicating the plot, we will also learn how to:
 various data pre-processing tricks such as separate a column into several columns, create date data from several columns, and reverse levels of a categorical column create a scatterplot with a custom shape/image as points using geom_smooth() for visualizing trend in the data explore facets and various theme editing on ggplot2  Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in below!</description>
