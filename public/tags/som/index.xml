      <description>Introduction Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) Self-Organizing Maps first introduce by Teuvo Kohonen. According to the Wiki, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map, and is therefore a method to do dimensionality reduction.1 SOM isan unsupervised data visualization technique that can be used to visualize high-dimensional data sets in lower (typically 2) dimensional representations.</description>
